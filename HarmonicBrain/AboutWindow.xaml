Harmonic Brain uses bilateral stimulation (alternating side-to-side stimulation):
By gently moving sound between your ears, Harmonic Brain helps activate your brainâ€™s hemispheres alternately, a technique commonly used in psychotherapies like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). This method is supported by research studies for its calming and focusing effects on the nervous system. Bilateral stimulation has been shown to reduce anxiety, enhance focus, and support better sleep.
